# Static Sign Language Recognition

This project recognises the various static symbols that are part of ASL and classifies them based on k-nearest neighbour algorithm.

The images were retrieved from a video, filmed at 640x480 using a mobile camera. Further image processing was done to retrive ROIs from the images and resize them to create a uniform dataset for the pattern recognition algo.

Libraries used:

Image processing: OpenCV
Classification (ML): Scikit-learn
Langauge: Python
